4: by this point, the larger plot will be heavily affected by whose threads you've engaged with and whose levels are higher. Aidan's descent is in full swing. anomalies are escalating, maybe odd portals popping up around town? some romantic threads are cut off, if your ship levels are below a certain threshold by beginning of the act, and there will be more mutually exclusive choices throughout this act too. just about every character can be involved with this Aidan plot, so whomever you're close to, you will experience the plot from that angle. and maybe each character has their own different take on the matter, and will involve themselves to different degrees. for example I can see Daisuke staying out of Aidan's corruption directly, but still trying to handle the strange beasts coming through the portals in his own way, and maybe Sebastian helps him by being the knowledge to his strength by researching how to close the portals. inevitably, you get involved with the big ritual of Aidan's. either your highest relationship is lured or captured to be the sacrifice in the ritual, or you are, and the other comes to their rescue. if you're not particularly close with anyone, then you are probably captured and have to figure your own way out. if you are close with Aidan already, then you have the option to be a willing participant or - if you've REALLY maxed the level - you might convince or trick Aidan into being the sacrifice instead and carry out the ritual yourself. you might also trap him and then stop the ritual. if you interrupt the ritual via rescue or being rescued, then it falls apart, and if your rescuer/rescue is sympathetic to Aidan then maybe you can try to save him? or maybe that option only pops up if your level with Aidan is high enough. either way, you get some kind of denouement post-ritual.
