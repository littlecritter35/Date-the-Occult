3: main event beat is big town hall vote or election (is there potential to nominate another character to become mayor, or is this more about passing a motion? does Will or Darian get his way? do you need to snoop around Will's to gather evidence that he's not who he seems? your level with Will can also determine how exactly THAT scene goes - if you're under a certain % he doesn't have you on his radar and uses amnesia serum on you or something. if you're in the middle, he traps you for a bit and you gather some intel. if you're above a certain % he has more fun with you/you can potentially join him, and your romantic plot with Darian is effectively shut off. if you're high with both of them, you can play out the scene a little first but you do have to make the hard decision after to choose one of them, i.e. you tell Darian the intel or not.) some Act 2 threads are still open in Act 3, basic character bonds and investigative threads that sort of thing. there's still time to find out if Dean is a werewolf and such. by the end of this act Will's crazy is fully revealed in one way or another. if you're not on his radar, Darian or possibly another character you've gotten close to gets you to Will's lab - Darian encouraging you to snoop, Roman bringing you to a dinner party at Will's manor, etc. In fact if you spent Halloween with certain characters (like maybe Dean is at the trunk or treat with Will), or your level is high enough with characters Will watches closely (Roman, Reggie, Darian) then you do make it onto his radar, and if you're not investigating his house yourself by a certain date in Act 3 then you get kidnapped instead. by the end of Act 3, your choices affect the big town hall vote, which will result in either an escalation of Will's plot or a neutralization of it.
