Act 5??? maybe there should be some kind of convergent event, like a huge storm that different groups capitalize on? there should also be some secret organizations/faceless villains to contend with, to make Will and Aidan more than just big bads.
I wanna come up with some kinda convergent event for an actual act 5, and have background villain groups (the cult, maybe a rival vampire gang, maybe a radical political group, etc) and maybe there's an intersection of time that would have all of them capitalizing on the same night to carry out crazy plans. but you only get the reveal/stop apocalypse of whichever group you've interacted with most/ stumbled on more clues for their existence and plans
so like a storm, a cosmic event or alignment, a calendar day/anniversary of a date, a moon phase, all happening on the same night
And your main bae is probably locked in, you get a little honeymoon period with them before the big night looms on ya.
