1: meet all the characters. partway through, Daisuke shows up. investigate some smaller mystery threads, which can also lead you to the characters. plenty of time to bond with different people. end of act requirements: you have met all characters, and gotten at least one ship level to a certain percent (there is likely a max level per act, and a fixed # interactions you can have per character to be triggered whenever). you have interacted with at least one mystery thread to its act 1 end point (there are smaller threads leading to small reveals at mid-plot like Dean is a werewolf and Roman is a vampire, and larger threads leading to bigger plots like Will's or Aidan's pursuits). a certain amount of time has passed (i.e. one full moon cycle).
purpose: player is given enough time to engage with all pieces of plot in Act 1. there are little to no true "eliminations" in Act 1, meaning you are able to explore all the threads and characters without cutting off major paths. choices can still affect your levels though, if you are selecting unfavored dialogue options in character interactions for example.
