2: Sebastian settles into the rhythms of the town. it's Halloween season now, so we see the influence of that on the setting (i.e. fall decorations, anticipation of holidays), and there's particularly an opportunity with Sebastian's personal interests to use the holiday for his investigation somehow. this could be exploring a cemetery during the witching hour, doing a joint spell with Darian and/or Aidan, etc. each character has more bonding events that can be triggered, and progression depends on where your levels are at with them at the start of the act. (would it serve the game or plot to have the ability to move your level in an adversarial direction, or do we just let the antagonist beats hit where they will in the timeline and if your ship level is higher they go a little differently?) You have about the same length of calendar as Act 1, and it ends after Halloween, which you spend however you will (maybe you have an option to spend it with any character whose level is high enough BY Halloween, i.e. investigating or doing some ritual or spell with Darian or Aidan or on your own, having a comforting evening with Dean, going to Reggie's rager or Roman's masquerade or a fucking trunk or treat with Will because if you're getting close to him you don't know he's crazy yet). during this act you have the opportunity to investigate any threads further, and could potentially hit the minor character reveals if you're nosey enough. there's slightly higher relationship stakes, as more event options may be mutually exclusive, making you choose to further one character's level over another. whomever you're spending your time with, you catch wind of some political dispute forming, whatever ongoing issue is debated here between Will and Darian, and you can learn more about it and get other characters' inputs.
